# Sweater Weather - Front End

This application uses a back-end API built using Ruby on Rails. You can visit the repository for that project [here](https://github.com/mikecm1141/sweater_weather).

## Description/Purpose

This front-end application was built to interact with an API I made in Ruby on Rails. The application serves up weather data based on user input. It also allows users to register and login, and to favorite locations they have viewed.

This project was built with the goal of learning more about using JavaScript to interact with an external API. It also allowed me time to practice using concepts like CSS Grid and asynchronous JavaScript.

## APIs Used

* [Dark Sky Weather API](https://darksky.net/dev)
* [Flickr Photo Service](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) - for background images based on location
* [Google Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) - for finding latitude and longitude based on city, state input

## Setup
To run this project locally, `git clone` this repository to your local machine. Once in the project directory, run `npm install` to install the required node modules. `npm start` will load up a server for you to view at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Contributors

This project was solely built by Mike McKee with some code review by Andrew Mockett.
